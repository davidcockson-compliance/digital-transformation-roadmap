# Business Requirements

This document outlines the core business requirements for the digital transformation, organized by key functional areas. The requirements are written as user stories to ensure a clear focus on end-user needs.

### Regulatory Reporting

* **As a Compliance Officer,** I need a single dashboard to view all pending regulatory reports so that I can ensure all deadlines are met.
* **As a Compliance Officer,** I need the system to automatically generate reports in the required format for various jurisdictions (e.g., UKGC, MGA) so that I can reduce manual work and the risk of formatting errors.
* **As an auditor,** I need to be able to access historical reports and the data used to create them so that I can conduct a thorough and efficient audit.

### Data Management & Integrity

* **As a risk analyst,** I need to access real-time data from multiple sources (e.g., payments, user accounts) in a single platform so that I can quickly identify and investigate fraudulent activity.
* **As a manager,** I need a system that validates data before it is stored so that I can trust the accuracy of the reports I generate.

### Compliance Monitoring

* **As a compliance professional,** I need to set up automated alerts for high-risk activities so that I am notified immediately when a user's behavior requires review.
* **As a compliance manager,** I need to be able to generate reports on the effectiveness of our compliance controls so that I can demonstrate our adherence to regulations during an assessment.
