# Technology Stack Recommendations

This document outlines the recommended technology stack for the digital transformation project. The choices are based on a focus on scalability, security, and integration capabilities to support a modern, data-driven compliance framework.

* **Cloud Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure**
    * **Reasoning:** These platforms offer robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure. They provide a wide range of services for data storage, processing, and analytics that are essential for building a flexible and reliable compliance system.

* **Data Warehouse: Snowflake or BigQuery**
    * **Reasoning:** A cloud-native data warehouse is crucial for consolidating data from disparate sources. Tools like Snowflake or BigQuery are optimized for high-performance analytics, allowing for fast, complex queries on large datasets for real-time reporting.

* **Reporting & Business Intelligence (BI) Tool: Tableau or Power BI**
    * **Reasoning:** To visualize compliance metrics and create interactive dashboards, a powerful BI tool is necessary. Tableau and Power BI can connect directly to the data warehouse, enabling stakeholders to gain real-time insights without needing to access raw data.

* **Automation & Workflow Engine: AWS Lambda or Azure Functions**
    * **Reasoning:** Serverless computing services are ideal for automating repetitive compliance tasks, such as data validation, report generation, and alert triggering. They are cost-effective and scale automatically based on demand.
